    <h1>Objective</h1>
    <p class="boxed">
        The field of speech recognition has experienced significant advancements in recent
        years, primarily driven by the development of algorithms and the availability of
        datasets. Despite these, the recognition and identification of words in Kokborok
        remains a relatively unexplored domain. Kokborok, dominantly spoken in Tripura by
        most of the tribal communities, represents an integral component of the region’s
        cultural heritage. As such, there is a pressing need for efforts directed towards its digital
        preservation and broader dissemination. The motivation for this paper stems from the
        urgent requirement to develop methodologies for recognizing and processing Kokborok
        words. Such efforts can contribute to preserving the linguistic diversity of the region.
        With these machine learning techniques, this study aims to bridge the gap between
        technological advancements and the preservation of languages, specifically focusing on
        Kokborok.

    <h1>Outcome</h1>
    <p class="boxed">
        This study has demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques to the identification
        and recognition of Kokborok words, utilizing advanced acoustic feature extraction methods such
        as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients
        (LPCC), and Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP). By processing audio recordings from native
        Kokborok speakers and extracting critical acoustic features, software models capable of
        recognizing Kokborok words with a reasonable degree of accuracy were developed. The usage
        of PRAAT software for extracting formant frequencies (F1, F2, and F3) and intensity values,
        combined with the powerful machine learning capabilities of the WEKA platform, enabled a
        comprehensive analysis of the speech data. Although initial results indicated a need for further
        refinement, subsequent normalization and feature scaling efforts led to improved model
        performance. These findings contribute significantly to the field of speech recognition for lesserstudied
        languages, highlighting the potential of integrating linguistic research with advanced
        computational techniques. This research not only aids in the digital preservation of the Kokborok
        language but also provides a framework that can be adapted to other indigenous languages facing
        similar challenges.

    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p class="boxed">
        The main aim of this paper is to leverage open-source software tools like PRAAT© to
        extract audio features and implement machine learning techniques, specifically using
        WEKA©, for the recognition of Kokborok words as shown in Figures 1 and 2 for male
        and female datasets. By employing sophisticated feature extraction methods such as
        Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP), this work endeavors to
        develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying
        Kokborok words (mainly numerals or numbers). These features, which capture various
        characteristics of the speech signal, are crucial for achieving precise and efficient
        speech recognition. This study focuses on examining and comparing different acoustic
        features, including formant frequencies, intensity, PLP, and MFCC, for the purpose of
        identifying Kokborok words. Formants, which are the resonant frequencies of the vocal
        tract, play a vital role in differentiating vowel sounds. The first formant (F1) relates to
        the height of the vocal tract segments, the second formant (F2) pertains to their
        backness, and the third formant (F3) involves other segment qualities. These
        frequencies are essential for capturing the nuanced audio features of speech, thereby
        providing a foundation for distinguishing between different Kokborok words. By
        focusing on these specific acoustic features, the study aims to enhance the
        understanding of their contribution to the recognition of Kokborok words. Additionally,
        this research seeks to implement and evaluate advanced feature extraction techniques,
        such as MFCC and PLP, for processing Kokborok speech. The objective is to develop
        a machine-learning model that can accurately identify Kokborok words based on the
        extracted features.
